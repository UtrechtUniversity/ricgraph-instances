# Pilot project Open Ricgraph demo server

This pilot project has started in September 2025.

## Aim of the pilot project
The aim of the pilot project is to demonstrate how Ricgraph
(Research in context graph)
can provide insights into research relations and collaborations, and how it can
optimize the quality of research information. 

The approach we take is to collect research information from participating
organizations and from multiple source systems, and to combine it in a single
graph. By organizing research information in a network of connected items and
relations, users can infer new relations, relations that are not present in any
of the source systems. 
The result is openly available to anyone, in accordance with the open science
principles.
