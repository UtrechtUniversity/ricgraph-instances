<h1>Pilot project Open Ricgraph demo server</h1>
This is the <em>Open Ricgraph demo server</em>. 
It is a pilot project that has the aim to demonstrate how 
<a href="https://www.ricgraph.eu" 
   target="_blank">Ricgraph</a>
can provide
insights into research relations and collaborations, and how it can optimize
the quality of research information.

The approach we take is to collect research information from participating
organizations and from multiple source systems, and to combine it in a single
graph. By organizing research information in a network of connected items and
relations, users can infer new relations, relations that are not present in any
of the source systems.
